Week 9 Challenge at Maker's Academy
----------------

Make a basic clone of Reddit
It should inlude tabs that will allow posts to be sorted (Hot, Top, Rising, Controversial, New)
Unsubscribed users (or those that are not logged in) can view and ssort posts but cannot make them
Users, when logged in, can make posts.
Posts can be links or text (and a different form is used for each).
